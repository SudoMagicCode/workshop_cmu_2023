The first time you open any new application it can be frustrating or confusing as you try to understand how the interface works. TouchDesigner is a node based toolkit, and while it's similar to many tools, it's also distinctly unique. We'll take a little time to cover the basics of getting around the environment, and how to understand what we're seeing. Before you know it you'll be zooming around your networks like it's second nature.

> Half of learning a new tool or development environment is just figuring out where all the knobs and buttons are. In this first course weâ€™ll focus on getting your bearings in TouchDesigner, learning the essential interface elements and controls, as well as the fundamental principles of each operator family.

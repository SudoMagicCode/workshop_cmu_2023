Operators are the building blocks of our TouchDesigner networks. In a typically TouchDesigner project you'll find a series of operators connected by wires into a network. These networks make up the code for your project. The operators in our networks are separated into families which also represent that kinds of data that they contain.

## TOPs

> A picture’s worth a thousand words… in TouchDesigner we work with images all the time, and the texture operator family is our primary means of manipulating pixels. From importing files to building visual FX this course will look at how we work with images and video, and how we can manipulate them in TouchDesigner.

## CHOPs

> Channel operators (CHOPs) are the signals and controls that bring a TouchDesigner project to life. CHOPs bring in controls from outside devices, allow us to work with Audio, build simple state machines, and animate elements in the network. This course will cover the principal aspects of the channel operator family, as well as examine use cases and mechanics that will help you build your first interactive project.

## SOPs

> With a long history in authoring 3D worlds and figures, TouchDesigner’s roots reach back to principles of non-destructive procedural geometry authoring. Surface Operators (SOPs) are the geometric and modeling primitives in the TouchDesigner environment; they’re also our introduction to the world of real time rendering and open a world of opportunities for creating both artistic and technical visual worlds

## DATs

> Text, tables, and scripts – a little bit of Python can go a long way; from controlling how operators function in the network, to more complex state and preset machines. While it’s not required that you learn Python to use TouchDesigner, it does open a wide world of possibilities for expanding your projects and creativity. In this course we’ll dip our toe into the scripting waters while also learning about the flexibility and power of the text based operators in TouchDesigner.

## COMPs

> Making something visually compelling only half the story, it’s also important to consider how you paint the world with the pixels you’ve manipulated. In this course we’ll look at the essential organization and output mechanics for displaying your work on a screen or through a projector. We’ll also look some the high level organizational capabilities in TouchDesigner, and how this can make your projects easier to navigate.

> In addition to building aesthetically focused elements, TouchDesigner is also used to author full UI packages for applications, exhibition pieces, and installations. In this lesson, we’ll look at the building blocks for creating interactive user interfaces, as well as how to build resolution adaptable elements.

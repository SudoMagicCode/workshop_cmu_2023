# TD Workshop CMU 2023

The Frank-Ratchye STUDIO for Creative Inquiry is excited to offer a public-facing workshop with support from the National Endowment for the Arts and the Carnegie Mellon School of Drama. Seats are limited! 

## Getting Ready
Before we begin, there are a few important things to keep in mind that will make the workshop run smoothly, and ensure you can focus on getting the most out of our time together. Below you’ll find a list of required first steps / tools to have with you, and some recommended steps to help you prepare.

### REQUIRED
Bring you Laptop – Mac or PC. Make sure you review the [System Requirements] from Derivative so you know you have a machine that’s TouchDesigner ready.
Don’t forget your power adapter – TouchDesigner is largely a GPU based environment. This makes for fast operations, but often means that your battery will get consumed quickly. You’ll definitely want your adapter, even if it’s a pain to lug around.

Download [TouchDesigner 099] – it’s very important to make sure your machine can run TouchDesigner before you get to the workshop. There are some specific graphics card requirements and making sure everything works before the first day will make sure we can get the group started right away.

Get your TouchDesigner 099 License – you can register for a Derivative account here - [Derivative Registration], and that will make sure you can create a non-commercial license key. The non-commercial license is free, and we won’t need anything more than this for our workshop.

### RECOMMENDED
A 3 Button mouse – You certainly can use a track pad while you’re working, but you’ll be much happier to have an actual mouse for working in Touch.
Download and Install a text Editor – [Visual Studio Code] is a great place to start if you don't have one.

Bring some Assets – You certainly don’t have to bring any extra assets, but it’s often nice to have more than just the stock images / videos handy.
Business Cards – the best resources you’ll find at any workshop will be the other people in the room with you. If you’ve got some extra business cards make sure you bring a stack to share with the folks in our group.

### BE INSPIRED

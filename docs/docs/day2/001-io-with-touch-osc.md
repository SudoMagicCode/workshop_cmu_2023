## Getting Started

Building interfaces for your projects is no small feat and there are lots of ways to approach this challenge. While TouchDesigner itself has a built-in UI system it's often helpful to separate your UI schema from your project. You might create a web interface with something like tools like:

* [Open Stage Control](http://openstagecontrol.ammd.net/)
* [Node Red](https://nodered.org/)
* [OSCAR](https://www.createwithoscar.com/)

If you wanted to use a dedicated app instead of something web based you might consider:

* [TouchOSC]
* [OSC/PILOT](https://oscpilot.com/)

Any of the solutions above will help you create an interface that's on a different screen or even a different computer than your TouchDesigner project's main output. For this workshop we're going to use [TouchOSC]. Full disclosure, there is both a free and paid version of this app - for this workshop we'll only be using features that are in the free version. The latest version of TouchOSC runs on Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS - which makes it easy to build an interface on your desktop and then share it to your mobile device.

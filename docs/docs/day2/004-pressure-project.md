Pressure what now? 

The intention of a pressure project is tackle a challenge or prompt in a short period of time. In this case the "pressure" in the project is only because it's intended to be a fast sketch as a way to explore and experiment - not something that needs to be polished or perfect. Our pressure project is going to combine the skills we've learned over the past two days - you're welcome to borrow any of the techniques we've explored or code we've written together. You're also encouraged to experiment and explore ideas that may have been percolating over the course of the workshop. Both of the instructors will be circulating during your worktime, so feel free to ask for help if you get stuck.

:::tip Code is only efficient or inefficient

As much as it'd be great if there was a single "right" way to solve a problem or achieve an outcome, programming is mostly about efficiency. There's not wrong way to solve a problem in TouchDesigner - it might be more efficient to use one technique over another, but it's important to explore and try different techniques. Don't be afraid to explore an idea just because it might slow down your computer.
